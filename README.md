# Kalman-Filtering-on-Lie-Groups

This is a documentation of my project titled "Kalman Filtering on Lie Groups". We initially look at an implementation of a simple Kalman Filter in the context of Euclidean Spaces, and then look at expanding it to Lie Groups, which has applications in diverse fields in control.
